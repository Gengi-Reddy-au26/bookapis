#What are Bitwise Operators in Python?

#Bitwise operators in Python are functions and or methods that are used to
#perform bit operations. In simple terms it is the process of converting integers
#and strings into bits that are 0 and 1. By using these operators, you are urging
#Python to either shift them from left to right or convert them into a sequence of
#0s and 1s. For example, 0100, 1100, 1000, 1001.

# a = 9
# b = 65
# print("Bitwise AND Operator On 9 and 65 is = ", a & b)
# print("Bitwise OR Operator On 9 and 65 is = ", a | b)
# print("Bitwise EXCLUSIVE OR Operator On 9 and 65 is = ", a ^ b)
# print("Bitwise NOT Operator On 9 is = ", ~a)
# print("Bitwise LEFT SHIFT Operator On 9 is = ", a << 1)
# print("Bitwise RIGHT")
